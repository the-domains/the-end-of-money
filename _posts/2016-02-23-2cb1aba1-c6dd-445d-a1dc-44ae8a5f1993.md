I believe...

That "nothing ever goes away until it teaches us what we need to know." ~ Pema Chodron

****

Money is here to teach us how to be in right relationship with it.

How do you know if you're out of rightness?

If it's in your life. 

Because everything meaningful happens in relationship - and

you're in relationship with money and economic systems.

If it's not in your life the way you wish it to be, you may find yourself in one of two camps. One, disconnected from Source, believing that money is dirty, corrupt, or bad OR two, disconnected from Source, and exploiting in order to have it.

****

I believe that all our power is internal, then flows from there, like a spring. Everything we look at (Trump Towers on West Side Highway) is only there because we believe it is. It's only there because it first existed inside some people's heads. 

****

It's an inside job.

****

All is sourced. Sourced. Every single thing you see was manifested
